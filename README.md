# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

I try to:
- Write clean, readable code.
- Promote ideomatic python.
- Write fast enough code.
- Make it all the way.
- Come up with my own sollutions from scratch unless really stuck.
- Get a good nights sleep.
- Have fun!

I try not to:
- Compete with anyone other than myself.
- Optimize speed beyond the scope of a silly puzzle.
- Overwork a working sollution.
